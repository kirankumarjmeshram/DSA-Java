Dynamic Programming:
--------------------
==> almost it is same like recursion
==> recursion with optimized solution is nothing but DP

What is dynamic programming?
----------------------------
dynamic programming is optimized recursion process.

How to identify DP is applicable for a problemm.

1. optimal problem
2. same calculation repeatedly used

There are two ways are there to solve DP

1. memoization (top-down) (recursion, reuse the solutions)
2. tabulation (bottom-up) (arrays)
