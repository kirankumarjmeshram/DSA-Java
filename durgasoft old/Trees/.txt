==> It is non linear data structure.
==> best suitable ds for search operations.
==> hierarchical represenation of data.

Ex: Banking System, Software, FileSystem, Family Tree etc

a tree is a finate set of one or more nodes such that

1. there is a specially desinged node called ROOT.
2. remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0, disjoint sets, called as sub-trees

TREE TERMINOLOGIES
------------------

Root:
-----
It is a unique node, which is not having incoming edges.

Example: A

Node:
-----
It is a fundamental part of a tree, each node has two pointers one is pointing to left sub-tree and another one is pointing to the right sub-tree.

Examples: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L

Edge:
-----
It is fundamental part of tree, used to connect two nodes.

Examples: AB, AC, BD, BE, BF, CG, CH, DI, DJ, FK, HL

Path:
-----
An ordered list of nodes, that are connected by edges called as path

Ex: AL ---> AC, CH, HL

Leaf Nodes:
-----------
The nodes which are not having any children or outgoining edges.

Ex: I, J, E, K, G, L

height of the tree:
-------------------
Height of the tree is number of edges on the longest path root to leaf.

Ex: 3

Level of the tree:
------------------
The level of tree or node is the number of edges on the path from root to that node.

Ex: 
    0 => A
    1 => B & C
    2 => D E F G & H
    3 => I J K & L

Parent:
-------
Node is said to be parent if it is linked with out going edges.

Ex: A, B, C, D, F, H

Child:
------
Node is said to be child if it is having incoming edges.

Ex: B C D E F G H I J K L

Sblings:
--------
Nodes which are children of same parent is called as siblings.

Ex: bc, def, gh, ij

ancestor:
---------
a node which is reachable through repeated moving from child to parent.

Ex: L ---> H, C, A

Degree or the node:
-------------------
The number of sub-trees attached to that node is called as Degree of the node

Degree of the tree:
-------------------
The max degree of the node present in the tree is called as degree of tree

Ex: D(Tree) = 3

PREDECESSOR:
------------
While traversing or displaying a tree, if a node occurrs previous to some other node, then that node is called as predecessor.

Ex: DEF predecessor of E is D

SUCESSOR:
---------
While traversing or displaying a tree, if a node occurrs after to some other node, then that node is called as successor.

Ex: DEF successor of E is F


BINARY TREE
-----------
a binary tree is a type of tree in which each node has atmost two children. that is zero or one child or two children. first child is called as left-child and second child is called as right-child.

Example: Digaram

Properties of Binary Tree:
--------------------------
1. max number of nodes on level i of binary tree is 2^i.
2. there should be exactly one path should be there from root to any node.
3. tree with 'N' nodes has exactly 'N-1' edges connecting these nodes.
4. the hegiht of the binary tree is logN


binary tree traversals (inorder,preorder,postorder)
---------------------------------------------------
Traversing means visiting each node present inside a tree, There are three types of methods are existed to visiting Tree.

1) Inorder -----> Left, Root, Right
2) Preorder ----> Root, Left, Right
3) Postoder ----> Left, Right, Root
