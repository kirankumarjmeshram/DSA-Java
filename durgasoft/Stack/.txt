stack is a basic linear data structure that orgaizes elements in Last-In-First-Out LIFO method, 
the object which is inserted at last will be the object that is removed first.

Ex:
	stack of plats / books / records

a stack allows you to access only one element from the top of stack / one direction i.e. top. 
when ever we are inserting a new object into stack then top value will be incremented by one unit. 
when ever we are removed one element from the stack then top variable will be decremented by one unit.

common operations on stack
--------------------------
The following are the common operations that can be performed on stack.

1. push() ----> inserting an element into the stack
2. pop() -----> deleting an element from the stack
3. peek() ----> return top most element in the stack
4. isEmpty()--> returns true if stack is empty else false
5. size() ----> return number of elements in the stack
6. search() --> return true if the element is existed else false

The following are the various representations that we are using for stack

1. implementation of stack using arrays.
2. implementation of stack by using linked list.
3. implementation of stack using predefined library.
